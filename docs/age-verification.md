# Age Verification Policy

**Effective Date:** November 25, 2025

This policy outlines the non-negotiable age verification requirements for ticket purchases and event entry on our ticketing platform. Compliance is mandatory for all ticket holders to ensure a safe, legally compliant, and enjoyable event experience. We are a ticketing service provider that enforces these policies on behalf of event organizers.

## 1. Age Classification

Age calculation is based on the date of birth provided at the time of ticket purchase, using the specific date of the event as the reference point.

| Classification | Definition | Application |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Adult** | 18 years of age or older | Permitted entry, full venue access, and legal alcohol consumption/purchase (as determined by the Event Organizer) |
| **Minor** | Under 18 years of age | Permitted entry (for non-Adult Only events), restricted from specific areas and alcohol service (as determined by the Event Organizer) |

## 2. Ticket Purchase Restrictions

### 2.1 Adult-Only Tickets (18+)

Certain designated ticket types are strictly restricted to Adults (18+) only. These tickets may include access to premium areas, VIP lounges, or areas where alcohol service is inherent to the ticket's value.

**Important**: 
- Minors are **NOT permitted** to purchase Adult-Only tickets
- Our ticketing system will **automatically block** transactions where the purchaser's provided date of birth classifies them as a Minor for an Adult-Only ticket
- The system calculates age at the time of ticket purchase and prevents minors from completing the purchase

### 2.2 Minor Tickets (Under 18)

Tickets designated for Minors grant access to the general event grounds but specifically exclude entry to all Age-Restricted Areas and alcohol-serving points.

### 2.3 Automatic Age Verification

Our platform automatically:
- Calculates age from the date of birth provided
- Determines if the ticket holder is an Adult or Minor
- Blocks purchase of Adult-Only tickets by Minors
- Flags tickets with age status for gate validation

## 3. ID Verification at Event Gate (The Gate Protocol)

All ticket holders, regardless of age classification, must comply with the ID Verification Protocol enforced by the Event Organizer.

### 3.1 Mandatory Photo ID

Every ticket holder must present valid government-issued photo ID at the event gate. Acceptable forms of ID include:

- National ID Card / Identity Document
- Driver's License
- Passport (valid and unexpired)
- Any other government-issued photo identification that clearly states the Date of Birth

### 3.2 Verification Procedure (Data Privacy Safeguard)

**Crucial Data Minimization Principle**: The gate staff (employed by the Event Organizer) will verify that:
- The photo on the ID matches the ticket holder
- The Date of Birth on the ID matches the ticket's registered age status
- The ticket is valid and verified for payment

**No Data Storage by Ticketing Platform**: As per our Privacy Policy, we do not, and will not, scan, copy, photograph, or digitally record any information from your government-issued ID.

**Visual Only**: The verification process is visual only and serves solely to confirm identity and age eligibility at the point of entry.

### 3.3 Gate Validation Process

When your ticket is scanned at the event gate:

1. **QR Code Validation**: Your ticket's QR code is scanned and validated
2. **Payment Verification**: The system checks that your payment has been verified
3. **Date Validation**: For day pass tickets, the system verifies the ticket is valid for the current event date
4. **Age Status Check**: The system displays your age status (Adult/Minor) for gate staff
5. **ID Verification**: Gate staff visually verify your ID matches the ticket information
6. **Entry Grant**: Upon successful validation, entry is granted and the ticket is marked as used

## 4. Age-Restricted Activities & Areas (Enforced by Event Organizer)

### 4.1 Alcohol Purchase and Consumption

- Minors (under 18) are **strictly prohibited** from purchasing, possessing, or consuming alcohol anywhere on the event grounds
- All bar staff reserve the right to demand additional ID verification (e.g., secondary ID check) for any alcohol purchase
- Age verification may be required multiple times throughout the event

### 4.2 Restricted Areas

Areas deemed Adult-Only (e.g., VIP sections, designated smoking zones, licensed bars) will be clearly marked. Minors will not be granted access to these areas, even under adult supervision.

### 4.3 VIP Day Pass and Full Pass Tickets

- **VIP Day Pass**: Valid only for the specific event date selected at purchase
- **VIP Full Pass**: Valid for all event dates
- **Regular Day Pass**: Valid only for the specific event date selected at purchase
- **Regular Full Pass**: Valid for all event dates

All ticket types, including VIP tickets, are subject to the same age verification requirements.

## 5. Consequences of Non-Compliance or Fraud

Providing false age information, using fraudulent identification, or attempting to breach any age restriction is strictly prohibited and carries immediate consequences, enforced by the Event Organizer:

- **Ticket Cancellation**: The ticket will be immediately cancelled without prior notice
- **No Refund**: No refund will be provided for tickets cancelled due to false information, fraud, or non-compliance
- **Denial of Entry/Ejection**: The individual will be denied entry to the event or immediately ejected if non-compliance is discovered inside the venue
- **Legal Action**: The Event Organizer reserves the right to pursue all available legal remedies, including reporting fraudulent activity to law enforcement

## 6. Your Responsibilities

By purchasing a ticket and attending the event, you acknowledge and agree to:

1. **Provide Accurate Information**: Provide accurate date of birth information during ticket purchase
2. **Carry Valid ID**: Carry the required valid government-issued photo ID to the event
3. **Comply with Instructions**: Comply instantly with all instructions from Event Organizer staff regarding age verification
4. **Respect Restrictions**: Do not attempt to enter or remain in Age-Restricted Areas if classified as a Minor
5. **One-Time Use**: Understand that tickets are valid for one-time use only and will be marked as used upon entry

## 7. Payment Verification
