Age Verification Policy

Effective Date: November 25, 2025

This policy outlines the non-negotiable age verification requirements for ticket purchases and event entry. Compliance is mandatory for all ticket holders to ensure a safe, legally compliant, and enjoyable event experience. The Site Operator collects the Date of Birth (DOB) data only for initial registration and communication linkage; the Event Organizer enforces physical ID verification at the event gate.

1. Age Classification

Age calculation is based on the date of birth provided at the time of ticket purchase, using the specific date of the event as the reference point.

Classification

Definition

Application

Adult

18 years of age or older

Permitted entry, full venue access, and legal alcohol consumption/purchase (as determined by the Event Organizer).

Minor

Under 18 years of age

Permitted entry (for non-Adult Only events), restricted from specific areas and alcohol service (as determined by the Event Organizer).

2. Ticket Purchase Restrictions

2.1 Adult-Only Tickets (18+)

Certain designated ticket types are strictly restricted to Adults (18+) only. These tickets may include access to premium areas, VIP lounges, or areas where alcohol service is inherent to the ticket's value.

Minors are NOT permitted to purchase Adult-Only tickets.

The ticketing system (managed by the Third-Party Platform) will automatically block transactions where the purchaser’s provided date of birth classifies them as a Minor for an Adult-Only ticket.

2.2 Minor Tickets (Under 18)

Tickets designated for Minors grant access to the general event grounds but specifically exclude entry to all Age-Restricted Areas and alcohol-serving points.

3. ID Verification at Event Gate (The Gate Protocol)

All ticket holders, regardless of age classification, must comply with the ID Verification Protocol enforced by the Event Organizer.

3.1 Mandatory Photo ID

Every ticket holder must present valid government-issued photo ID at the event gate. Acceptable forms of ID include:

National ID Card / Identity Document

Driver’s License

Passport (valid and unexpired)

Any other government-issued photo identification that clearly states the Date of Birth.

3.2 Verification Procedure (Data Privacy Safeguard)

Crucial Data Minimization Principle: The gate staff (employed by the Event Organizer) will verify that the photo and Date of Birth on the ID match the ticket holder and the ticket's registered age status.

No Data Storage by Site Operator: As per our Privacy Policy, the Site Operator is strictly prohibited from, and does not, scan, copy, photograph, or digitally record any information from your government-issued ID.

Visual Only: The verification process is visual only and serves solely to confirm identity and age eligibility at the point of entry.

4. Age-Restricted Activities & Areas (Enforced by Event Organizer)

4.1 Alcohol Purchase and Consumption

Minors (under 18) are strictly prohibited from purchasing, possessing, or consuming alcohol anywhere on the event grounds.

All bar staff reserve the right to demand additional ID verification (e.g., secondary ID check) for any alcohol purchase.

4.2 Restricted Areas

Areas deemed Adult-Only (e.g., VIP sections, designated smoking zones, licensed bars) will be clearly marked. Minors will not be granted access to these areas, even under adult supervision.

5. Consequences of Non-Compliance or Fraud

Providing false age information, using fraudulent identification, or attempting to breach any age restriction is strictly prohibited and carries immediate consequences, enforced by the Event Organizer:

Ticket Cancellation: The ticket will be immediately cancelled without prior notice.

No Refund: No refund will be provided for tickets cancelled due to false information, fraud, or non-compliance.

Denial of Entry/Ejection: The individual will be denied entry to the event or immediately ejected if non-compliance is discovered inside the venue.

Legal Action: The Event Organizer reserves the right to pursue all available legal remedies, including reporting fraudulent activity to law enforcement.

6. Your Responsibilities

By purchasing a ticket and attending the event, you acknowledge and agree to:

Provide accurate date of birth information during the Site Operator's registration process.

Carry the required valid government-issued photo ID to the event.

Comply instantly with all instructions from Event Organizer staff regarding age verification.

Do not attempt to enter or remain in Age-Restricted Areas if classified as a Minor.
