Effective Date: November 25, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the Site Operator ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, protects, and handles your Personal Information when you register on our website to access ticket links and communication related to external events. We are not the Event Organizer, and we commit to absolute data minimization. We do not process or store any payment information.

3. Age Verification Data Handling (Data Minimization)

We apply strict data minimization standards to your limited personal information:

Date of Birth (DOB): Your DOB is collected at registration to assign your age status for website access. It is retained only as long as necessary for tax and contractual obligations (typically 5 years from the event date), unless you request earlier deletion (see Section 6).

Government-Issued Photo ID: As detailed in the Age Verification Policy (enforced by the Event Organizer), any ID presented at the event gate is checked by EVENT STAFF, not us. We do not, and will not, scan, copy, photograph, or store any digital or physical record of your ID.

4. How We Use Your Information

We use your data only for the purposes for which it was collected:

To manage your website registration and communicate event updates, changes, or cancellations via email.

To provide the Event Organizer with the necessary data to confirm your age status matches your ticket purchase.

To comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and legal processes (e.g., age restriction enforcement).

5. Data Storage and Security

Storage Location: All digital data (Email and DOB) is stored on secure, encrypted servers managed by our trusted third-party cloud providers, which adhere to strict industry-standard security protocols.

Security Measures: We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, including encryption, access controls, and firewalls, to protect your limited Personal Information from unauthorized access, loss, or theft.

Retention: We retain Personal Information only for the duration necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy or as required by law.

6. Sharing of Personal Information

We do not sell your Personal Information. We may share your data only in the following limited circumstances:

Event Organizer/Venue: We may share essential registration data (Email, DOB, Age Status) with the specific Event Promoter and/or Venue for the sole purpose of confirming compliance with their age restrictions and for operational purposes.

Service Providers: With third-party partners who perform services on our behalf (e.g., email service providers).

Legal Compliance: When required by law or necessary to respond to lawful requests and legal process.

7. Your Data Rights

You have the right to:

Access: Request a copy of the Personal Information (Email and DOB) we hold about you.

Rectification: Request correction of any inaccurate or incomplete data.

Erasure (Right to be Forgotten): Request that your data be deleted, subject to our legal and tax retention obligations.

Object: Object to the processing of your data for specific purposes (e.g., marketing).
