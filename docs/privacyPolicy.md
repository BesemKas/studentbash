# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** November 25, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how we ("we," "us," or "our") collect, use, protect, and handle your Personal Information when you use our ticketing platform to purchase tickets for events. We are a ticketing service provider that sells tickets on behalf of event organizers. We are not the event organizer, and we commit to data minimization while providing essential ticketing services.

| Category of Data | Specific Data Collected | Purpose of Collection | Legal Basis |

| **B. Ticket Holder Information** | Holder Name (Full Name), Email Address, Date of Birth (DOB) | Ticket creation, age verification, event communication, customer service | Legitimate Interest (Service Delivery) & Legal Obligation (Age Verification) |
| **C. Age Verification Data** | Date of Birth (DOB), Age Status (Adult/Minor) | Confirming age eligibility for ticket types, enforcing age restrictions, compliance with event rules | Legal Obligation & Legitimate Interest (Safety) |

## 2. Information We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect or store the following information:

- **Payment Method Details**: Credit card numbers, bank account information, or any financial payment data
- **Government-Issued ID**: We do not scan, copy, photograph, or store any digital or physical record of your ID (see Section 4)
- **Phone Numbers**: We do not require or store phone numbers
- **Billing Address**: We do not collect billing addresses

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use your data only for the following purposes:

1. **Ticket Management**: To create, manage, and validate your tickets
2. **Payment Verification**: To verify payment and activate your tickets
3. **Event Entry**: To validate tickets at event gates using QR code scanning
4. **Age Verification**: To enforce age restrictions and ensure compliance with event rules
5. **Communication**: To send ticket confirmations, payment verification notifications, and event updates
6. **Customer Service**: To respond to your inquiries and provide support
7. **Legal Compliance**: To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal processes

## 4. Age Verification Data Handling (Data Minimization)

We apply strict data minimization standards to your personal information:

### Date of Birth (DOB)
- Your DOB is collected when creating a ticket to determine age status (Adult/Minor)
- It is used to enforce age restrictions for adult-only ticket types
- It is retained only as long as necessary for tax and contractual obligations (typically 5 years from the event date), unless you request earlier deletion (see Section 7)

### Government-Issued Photo ID
- **Important**: Any ID presented at the event gate is checked by **EVENT STAFF** (employed by the Event Organizer), not by us
- We do not, and will not, scan, copy, photograph, or store any digital or physical record of your ID
- The verification process is visual only and serves solely to confirm identity and age eligibility at the point of entry
- This is enforced by the Event Organizer, not by our platform

## 5. Data Storage and Security

### Storage Location
All digital data is stored on secure, encrypted servers managed by our trusted third-party cloud providers, which adhere to strict industry-standard security protocols.

### Security Measures
We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, including:
- Encryption of data in transit and at rest
- Access controls and authentication
- Firewalls and intrusion detection
- Regular security audits and updates

### Retention
We retain Personal Information only for the duration necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy or as required by law. Ticket data is typically retained for 5 years from the event date for tax and contractual obligations.

## 6. Sharing of Personal Information

We do not sell your Personal Information. We may share your data only in the following limited circumstances:

### Event Organizers
We share essential ticket data (Holder Name, Email, DOB, Age Status, Payment Reference, QR Code) with the specific Event Organizer for:
- Event entry validation
- Age restriction compliance
- Operational purposes related to the event

### Service Providers
With third-party partners who perform services on our behalf (e.g., email service providers, cloud hosting providers), under strict confidentiality agreements.

### Legal Compliance
When required by law or necessary to respond to lawful requests and legal process.

## 7. Your Data Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access**: Request a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you
- **Rectification**: Request correction of any inaccurate or incomplete data
- **Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)**: Request that your data be deleted, subject to our legal and tax retention obligations
- **Object**: Object to the processing of your data for specific purposes (e.g., marketing)
- **Data Portability**: Request your data in a structured, machine-readable format

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information provided in Section 8.

## 8. Payment Information

**Important**: We do not process or store actual payment information. When you purchase a ticket:

- A **Payment Reference** is generated for tracking purposes
- You make payment externally (bank transfer, etc.) using this reference
- Payment verification is done manually by administrators
- We only store the payment reference, not your actual payment method or financial details

## 9. Third-Party Links

Our platform may contain links to external websites (e.g., event organizer websites). We do not control, endorse, or guarantee the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites. Access and use of external links are solely at your own risk.

## 10. Children's Privacy

Our platform is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
